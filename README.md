# Water Potability Classification Hackathon by IndabaX Nigeria 2021
##Description
The government of Nigeria is concerned with the exponentially increasing mortality rate due to the ingestion of unsafe water.

Research has shown that the majority of the citizens living in the rural part of Nigeria do not have access to good drinking water and lack proper orientation on the constituents of safe drinking water.

Access to safe drinking water is essential to health, a basic human right, and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional, and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

You have been contracted by Water Corporation in Nigeria to use artificial intelligence in automating the classification of water potability. This will serve as a decision support system for the experts in the field.

* This Project is carried out to build a model that can help automate the classification of water portability
